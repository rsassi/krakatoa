At this point testselector doesn't have a test suite to test itself.
It is therefore recommended to execute this list of tests prior before delivering any changes.

testselector --out tests.txt
testselector --out tests.txt --list-test-suites
testselector --out tests.txt --list-test-suites
testselector --out tests.txt --test-suites all 
testselector --out tests.txt --function e
testselector --test-runs 1
